<- Camera ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Camera class handles a Camera object.
The constructor requires these values:
- origin : A vertex representing the position of the camera
- orientation : A Matrix representing the orientation of the camera
- ratio : the quotient of the screen (width/height). Note that you can
  either send it a ratio , or both the width and height
- width and height : integer reprenting the size of the screen
- fov : the field of view in degrees
- near : the near clipping plan (int)
- far : the far clipping plan (int)

All these values possess getter's and setter's for your convinience.
Only one method is implemented :
- watchVertex: This method needs a vertex as an argument, the one wich is to 
be projected, and returns the corresponding new vertex in the camera coordinate.
